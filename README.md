# **Project II: huntWise**

## _About huntWise_

huntWise was inspired by being UCF Coding Bootcamp students, as we come closer to the end of the program we began searching for jobs in our new found field. huntWise seeks to help specifically coding and web design job hunters into their field of knowledge and specialty by focusing the job search engine to bring back jobs in the coding, web design and full stack field. huntWise is the "one-stop shop job hunt app for web developers!"

### _How We Began_

We began huntWise by researching popular job search API's, having to change our original idea from using certain ones we could not access we decided to use a streamlined API for the job search. We then decided three people would work on the front end design, creating a table that pulled in the focused search results on to a page appropriately titled, Results. Once the three were fit together the rest was history! 

### _What We Used_
